### Navigation
##### 1. Navigating through hierarchical structures is challenging.
Studies have shown that navigating tree structures is more challenging for people with low literacy. They prefer `linear navigation` (forward and back) and find it disorienting and counterintuitive to follow complex nesting, deep hierarchy, and scrolling interfaces as they move deeper into flows.

##### 2. Knowing when and where to tap, swipe, and long press is unclear.
The process of learning what’s clickable and what’s not can lead to users down incorrect pathways.
